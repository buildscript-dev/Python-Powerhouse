# Loop - repeating a task multiple time.
# Types of loop
# 1. For Loop - if we know how many time we have to perform the task.
# 2. While Loop - if we don't know then we use while loop except where to stop.

# range(start, stop , step) 
# for i in range(1,10+1,1):
#   print("Hello, How are you")

# userInput = int(input("Enter the number: "))
# for i in range(1,userInput+1,1):
#   print(f"5 * {i} = {5*i}")


# # Loop in a string
# s = "Hello, How are you."

# for i in s:
#   print(i)

# While LOop

a = 10 
i = 1
while a > 0:
  print(f"Pawan ki maa ki chut {i}")
  i = i+1
  a = a - 1


# break = exit or break the loop.

# continue = skip the perticular instance of the loop.

# else : connect to break.
